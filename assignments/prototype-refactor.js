/*

Prototype Refactor

1. Copy and paste your code or the solution from yesterday

2. Your goal is to refactor all of this code to use ES6 Classes. The console.log() statements should still return what is expected of them.

// Begin project!

/*
  Object oriented design is commonly used in video games.  For this part of the assignment you will be implementing several constructor functions with their correct inheritance hierarchy.

  In this file you will be creating three constructor functions: GameObject, CharacterStats, Humanoid.

  At the bottom of this file are 3 objects that all end up inheriting from Humanoid.  Use the objects at the bottom of the page to test your constructor functions.

  Each constructor function has unique properties and methods that are defined in their block comments below:
*/

/*
  === GameObject ===
  * createdAt
  * dimensions (These represent the character's size in the video game)
  * destroy() // prototype method -> returns the string: 'Object was removed from the game.'
*/


class GameObject{
  constructor(stuff){
  this.createdAt = stuff.createdAt;
  this.dimensions = stuff.dimensions
}
  destroy() {
    // return this.name + ' was removed from the game.'
    // see explodingbarrel.destroy() test,
    // undefined results returning is bad.
    // I have a theory that if I put in an if-else I can get error handling in case name is empty?
    if (this.name !== undefined) {
      return this.name + ' was removed from the game.'
      } else {
          return 'Object was removed from the game.'
    }
    // Verified, worked!
  }
} // GameObject

/*
  === CharacterStats ===
  * healthPoints
  * name
  * takeDamage() // prototype method -> returns the string '<object name> took damage.'
  * should inherit destroy() from GameObject's prototype
*/

class CharacterStats extends GameObject {
  constructor(stuff){
  super(stuff);
  this.healthPoints = stuff.healthPoints;
  this.name = stuff.name;
}
  takeDamage() {
    return this.name + ' took damage.'
  }
}


// I can't help but feel I'm doing something wrong with ordering things but whatever.



/*
  === Humanoid (Having an appearance or character resembling that of a human.) ===
  * team
  * weapons
  * language
  * greet() // prototype method -> returns the string '<object name> offers a greeting in <object language>.'
  * should inherit destroy() from GameObject through CharacterStats
  * should inherit takeDamage() from CharacterStats
*/

/*
  * Inheritance chain: GameObject -> CharacterStats -> Humanoid
  * Instances of Humanoid should have all of the same properties as CharacterStats and GameObject.
  * Instances of CharacterStats should have all of the same properties as GameObject.
